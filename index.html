              <h2>HENOK TEAGHES</h2>
              <p>I am an enthusiastic IT course and have a certificate in WordPress web
              I am proficient in HTML5, CSS, Java, SQL, Nodejs, and React.I use these skills
              to develop, test, and deploy web applications and platforms for various clients and
              projects.I also have a passion and expertise for web design and photo editing, which I
              leverage to enhance the visual experience and engagement of online users and audiences.
              I have four years of experience as a photo editor at a leading media company, where
              collaborated with a team of writers, designers, and photographers to produce high-quality
              content for different platforms. I also optimized the image database, automated the editing
              process, and improved the user interface using my web development skills. Additionally, I
              contributed to the digital collection of the Asmara Public Library as a library assistant,
              where I helped digitize and organize a variety of documents and media.I am motivated by the
              opportunity to use my computer science and photo editing skills to serve the needs and interests
              of diverse audiences and to learn new technologies and techniques that can improve my performance
               and creativity. I value collaboration, innovation, and quality in my work, and I strive to deliver
                excellent results in every project I undertake.</p>
